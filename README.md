# ðŸ“¸ JPG to PNG Converter â€” My First Python Script

This is my very first Python script â€” a simple JPG to PNG converter I built while learning Python on my developer journey.

It may be small, but it's a stepping stone toward mastering real-world programming skills like working with file systems, command-line tools, and libraries like Pillow.

## ðŸ§  What It Does

This script:
- Takes a folder full of `.jpg` images
- Converts each one to `.png`
- Saves the new `.png` images in a folder you specify

It's a clean, no-frills batch converter â€” built entirely in Python with less than 20 lines of code.

## ðŸ”§ How to Use

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) â€” a library for image processing

Install Pillow with:

```bash
pip install Pillow

Run the Script:
bash
python jpg_to_png.py input_folder output_folder

Example:
python jpg_to_png.py ./images ./converted
If the output folder doesnâ€™t exist, itâ€™ll be created automatically.

ðŸ§© Why I Built This
This is part of my learning path to become a Python developer. I wanted to start with something practical and hands-on â€” something that actually does something.

Along the way, I learned how to:

Work with external libraries (Pillow)

Handle command-line arguments

Read and write files with Python

Automate boring stuff (goodbye manual image converting)


ðŸš€ Next Steps
This project is just the beginning. Some ideas I might explore next:

Support for more image formats

Adding a progress bar or status messages

Basic error handling

A graphical version with a simple UI

âœ¨ Final Thoughts
Every coder starts somewhere â€” this is where Iâ€™m starting.
If youâ€™re on a similar path, feel free to fork it, play around, and make it your own.

Thanks for checking it out!
